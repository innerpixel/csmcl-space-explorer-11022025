# Fungible Tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens for (Gamified) Applications 

---

## 1. Introduction

Fungible Tokens (FTs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) serve as the backbone of blockchain-based applications. 
- **Fungible Tokens (FTs)**: Interchangeable tokens representing single utility, such as currency or rewards.

    CSMCL.SPACE uses CSM(cals ;) as fungible token   







- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Unique digital assets often used for collectibles, memberships, or unique items.

Together, they enable rich, token-driven ecosystems.

## 2. Use Case Overview

This document explores the combined use of FTs and NFTs in gamified applications:

1. **NFTs for Memberships**: Provide users with unique membership tokens granting exclusive benefits.
2. **FTs for Rewards and In-App Purchases**: Reward users for activities and enable in-app purchases using FTs.
3. **FT-NFT Interactions**: Integrate a marketplace where users can buy NFTs using FTs.

## 3. NFTs for Membership

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** represent memberships with unique benefits:

- **Membership Tiers**: Design NFTs for Silver, Gold, and Platinum levels, each offering distinct perks.
- **Usage**: Holders can access premium features, discounted purchases, or early access to content.

**Smart Contract Implementation**: Membership NFTs are created, transferred, and verified securely using smart contracts.

## 4. FTs for Rewards and Purchases

**Fungible Tokens (FTs)** act as an in-app currency and reward system:

- **Reward Mechanism**: Distribute FTs for achievements, such as completing challenges or logging in daily.
- **In-App Purchases**: Allow users to spend FTs on items, upgrades, or exclusive content.

FTs maintain liquidity and can be exchanged, spent, or staked within the application ecosystem.

## 5. FT-NFT Interactions

Integrate FTs and NFTs in your application:

- **Marketplace**: Enable users to purchase NFTs using FTs in a smart contract-based marketplace.
- **Discounts and Rewards**: Offer FT-based discounts for NFT holders, enhancing engagement.
- **Example**: A user with a Gold membership NFT receives a 10% discount on purchases made with FTs.

## 6. Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan**: Define tokenomics and use cases.
2. **Develop**: Implement FT and NFT smart contracts with Cadence.
3. **Test**: Validate contracts and interactions on Flow Testnet.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy contracts on Flow Mainnet and integrate with the frontend.
5. **Iterate**: Collect user feedback and update features.
